                        against each other to score the most points. The goal of the game is to score points by
                        interacting with the field elements and scoring with the game pieces. Points are scored in one
                        of two ways. The first and most common way, will be to successfully shoot or place the game
                        pieces into one of four goals each alliance is allowed to score within. The second way is that
                        robots can attempt to climb up their alliance's pyramid, earning points based on how far they
                        can ascend. At the end of the 2 minute and 15 second match, the alliance who could score faster
                        and climb the highest receives the most points and is declared the winner.</p><img src="/FIRST/Ultimate_Ascent/img/13-field.png"/><h3>The Field</h3><p>
                        Ultimate Ascent is played on a 27-foot by 54-foot field. Tape of the appropriate alliance color
                        denotes where each alliance's feeder areas are located and where the game pieces are placed
                        pre-game. Both ends of the field contain a single pyramid, one for each alliance. These pyramids
                        can be climbed for additional points at the end of the match, and have a small goal at their top
                        that the appropriate alliance can score in. Only robots of the correct alliance can climb a
                        pyramid and interact with the robots attempting their own climbs. In addition, at both ends of
                        the arena are four colored goals at three different heights, and each alliance's three feeder
                        stations. The higher the goal is off the ground, the more points it is worth, but also the more
                        difficult attempting to score in it is. At the feeder stations game pieces are entered into the
                        field or into robots. Robots cannot be interfered with while at their alliance's feeder station.
                        Behind the center goals on each side are the alliance stations, where teams operate their
                        robots. In addition, due to the added safety risks of flying game pieces in this year's game,
                        nets will be placed around the perimeter of the field to contain stray game pieces.

                        Ultimate Ascent is played using special <i>FIRST</i> discs. The discs are 11 inches in diameter
                        and are made of 180 grams of hard plastic. Each disc has the <i>FIRST</i> logo on the front.
                        Each robot is allowed to hold or control up to four of these discs at any one time.
                    </p><h3>Autonomous Period</h3><p>
                        During the first 15 seconds of the match the drivers are not allowed to control their robots.
                        Instead, teams pre-program their robots to be able to try and preform basic tasks, such as
                        scoring discs, collecting discs from the floor, or simply moving around. If a robot can
                        successfully score in one of the alliance station goals during this time, the points they score
                        are doubled. Attempts to climb the pyramid or score on its goal do not give any points during
                        this time.
                    </p><h3>Teleoperated Period</h3><p>
                        After the autonomous period drivers assume control of their robots. Teams are then able to score
                        by shooting or placing the discs into the alliance goals. The lowest goals are worth 1 point per
                        goal, the middle two alliance goals are worth 2 points, the highest alliance goal is worth 3
                        points, and the pyramid goals are worth 5 points each. At any point in Teleoperated period a
                        team can decide to try and get bonus points by climbing their alliance pyramid. Points are
                        awarded at the end of the match based on how high a robot climbed, as long as the robot managed
                        to stay attached to the pyramid. The pyramid is split into three sections. In order to be
                        considered in a higher section, a robot has to completely leave the section below it. The lowest
                        section is worth 10 points, the middle section worth 20 points, and the highest section worth 30
                        points. All robots that successfully climbed their tower earn points for their team.
                    </p><h3>Scoring</h3><p>
                        In Ultimate Ascent the points are calculated during the match, so at the end of the match the
                        total score for each alliance will be displayed. The total includes all of the points scored by
                        the robots, the additional points from climbing their alliance pyramid, and any points from
                        fouls. In Ultimate Ascent fouls give points to the other alliance, the amount varying depending
                        on the severity of the foul. In the end the alliance with the largest point total wins.
