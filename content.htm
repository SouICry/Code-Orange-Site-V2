                    <p> We are a high-school level robotics team located in Irvine, California. We participate in a
                        robotics league under an organization called FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science
                        and Technology). Since our inception in early 2010, we have participated in the annual robotics
                        challenge designed by FIRST. We have engaged in many community outreach activities, inspiring
                        thousands of kids towards interest in science, technology, and engineering. We are proud to be
                        engaged in a growing field that will surely affect the future of the world and eager to
                        encourage others towards the same ends.</p>
