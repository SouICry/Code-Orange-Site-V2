                    <h3>Build</h3>

                    <p>As a <i>FIRST</i> Robotics Competition team, we design and create a new robot every year based on
                        the rules of the competition game that year. Beginning in early January every year, we work
                        through
                        6 straight weeks of build season to analyze the game, prototype and design robot sub-assemblies,
                        machine our parts from scratch, assemble all structural and electrical components, and program
                        our robot. Through the next 7 weeks of competition season, we construct a second robot for
                        practice, and continue making improvements to our hardware and software</p>

                    <h3>Compete</h3>

                    <p>The official <i>FIRST</i> competition season lasts for 7 weeks, over the course which we attend 2
                        regional competitions, and finally the World Championship at the end of the 7 weeks when we
                        qualify. Out of the 5 years of our existence, we have made it to Worlds in the last 4 years,
                        which is an amazing achievement for even teams that have existed for much longer.</p>

                    <h3>Inspire</h3>

                    <p>After 4 hectic months of competition season, we demo our robot at many public events, and train
                        new students on the art of robot design and construction. We also attend some off-season
                        competitions where newer members can gain more experience and exposure to <i>FIRST</i> robots.
                    </p>

                    <p>We also help out many <i>FIRST</i> Lego League teams with constructing their robots, and outreach
                        to newer teams to teach and to inspire.</p>
