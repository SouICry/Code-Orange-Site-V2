                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>In Aerial Assist, two alliances consisting of three individual teams (red and blue), compete
                        against each other to score the most points. The goal of the game is to put large two foot
                        exercise balls into goals on either side of the arena, while assisting your partners to bring
                        the balls across the field.
                        Points can be scored in three ways: successfully scoring into goals,
                        assisting your alliance partners, and shooting the balls over the truss in the middle of the
                        field. Each alliance has two minutes and thirty seconds to score as many points as they can.
                    </p>

                    <h3>The Field</h3>

                    <p>
                        Aerial Assist is played on a 25-foot by 54-foot field. Colored tape separates the field into
                        three zones, the red zone, white zone, and the blue zone. Black tape extends from each low goal
                        to mark the front of the Goalie Zone. A large audio truss is stretched across the width of the
                        field. Robots can shoot the balls over the truss for points. On each end of the field are two
                        High Goals that are separated by a 1 foot wide divider. Each high goal is outlined with LED
                        light strings which will illuminate at various moments during a match. There are also two Low
                        Goals at each end of the field with openings on three of its' sides. Finally, there are two
                        pedestals behind each alliance station. Here balls will be kept waiting to be put into play by
                        the human player.

                    <h3>Game Objects</h3>

                    <p>
                        Aerial Assist is played with special 2 foot diameter exercise balls with red or blue FIRST
                        branded nylon covers. Each alliance may start with up to three balls during the autonomous
                        period, but must score any leftover autonomous balls before they are allowed to enter a new ball
                        into play.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Autonomous Period</h3>

                    <p>
                        During the first ten seconds of the match drivers are not allowed to control their robots.
                        Instead, teams pre-program their robots to be able to try and perform basic tasks. Each robot is
                        able to start with a ball and attempt to shoot it into either the High Goal or Low Goal. For the
                        first five seconds, one high/low pair of goals with be "hot" and award bonus points to robots
                        that score in the "hot goal". Robots may also be awarded points for moving their robot into
                        their zones.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Teleoperated Period</h3>

                    <p>
                        After the ten second Autonomous Period, drivers assume direct control of their robots. Alliances
                        must cycle balls from one end of the field into either goal, one at a time. Because of this,
                        points are awarded for making assists, tosses over the truss, and catches from tossed balls.
                        Once a ball is scored, another one can be taken from the alliance's pedestal and put into play.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Scoring</h3>

                    <p>
                        In Aerial Assist points are awarded after the ten second autonomous period ends and once a cycle
                        is complete. Alliances can gain more points per cycle by assisting each other through the three
                        zones. Assists are earned once a robot passes the ball from one zone to an alliance robot in
                        another zone. Up to three assists can be awarded per cycle. No bonus is awarded for cycles with
                        one assists. Two assists give a 10 point bonus. Three assists give a 30 point bonus. If a robot
                        tosses the ball over the truss, towards their goals, they will be awarded 10 points for that
                        cycle. If a robot catches their alliance partners truss toss, another 10 bonus points will be
                        awarded for the cycle. In Aerial Assist fouls give points to the other alliance, the amount
                        varying depending on the severity of the foul. In the end the alliance with the largest point
                        total wins.
